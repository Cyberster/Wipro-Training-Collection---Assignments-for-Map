 1. Develop a java class with a instance variable CountryMap  HashMap (M1)  add a method saveCountryCapital(String CountryName, String capital) , the method should add the passed country and capital as key/value in the map M1 and return the Map (M1).
Key- Country                          Value - Capital
India                                                   Delhi
Japan                                                Tokyo
2. Develop a method getCapital(String CountryName) which returns the capital for the country passed from the Map M1 created in step 1.
3. Develop a method getCountry(String capitalName) which returns the country for the capital name passed from the Map M1 created in step 1.
4. Develop a method which iterates through the map M1 and creates another map M2 with Capital as the key and value as Country and returns the Map M2.
Key – Capital                    Value – Country
Delhi                                           India
Tokyo                                        Japan
5. Develop a method which iterates through the map M1 and creates an ArrayList with all the Country names stored as keys. This method should return the ArrayList.
NOTE: You can test the methods using a main method.

 Create a Collection called HashMap which is capable of storing String objects. The program should have the following abilities
a) Check if a particular key exists or not 
b) Check if a particular value exists or not 
c) Use Iterator to loop through the map key set

a) Check if a particular key exists or not 
b) Check if a particular value exists or not 
c) Use Iterator to loop through the map key set
